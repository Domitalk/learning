<!-- in some cases, the alt is left blank on purpose
in this example, the alt image is simply a visual break point 
in other casers, sometimes there is a caption below the image that explains anyway
or in the case of background images, there's clearly no need for a caption and it's usually in the CSS file anyway  -->
