    <!-- header has embedded code to identify it as what it is for web crawl like main 
    it wraps intro info or navi links 
    it's usually for stuff that's always on top on multiple pages 

    this is diff from head (ie: body) which contains page's title and meta info 
    head would contain the stuff that would show up on the tab and more technical stuff 
    but header is a little diff?  -->
