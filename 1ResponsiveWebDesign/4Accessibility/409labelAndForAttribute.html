        <!-- remember this from making forms but basically inside the form, inputs always had id 
        this was often used for fetching and/or state in vanilla js 
        but with the label tag i always thought that it was just the way it was supposed to be as a label for the input field 
        and sometimes i would take out the label because it would still work 
        the reason why we use label is actually for accessibility and the for attribute associates it with the input 
        so that if someone is using a screen reader or any other type of accessibility feauture it'll speak it out and they can have the input filled in  -->
