<!-- it's important to understand that h tags create a hierarchy
h3 are children of h2 and h2 are children of h1 
it's tempting to use h5 on the h3s here because of the size differences 
but in fact, the algos that craw the internet won't understand the relationship 
h3s are supposed to be directly related to the h2s but if they're h5s, the algo won't see the relationship 
so instead of jumping h2 to h5, we style it in CSS instead to keep the relationship  -->
