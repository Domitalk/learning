      the default is to flex-start so that everything is flex beginning from the beginning of the axis
      flex-end makes the stacking start at the end of the axis 
      space-between centers on the axis and spaces equal between elements but when there is space left over, it'll make the elements go to the edges of the axis 
      space-around makes it so the first and last elements aren't at the edges of the axis and get HALF spaces between them and the edge 
      space-evenly makes it like space-around but with FULL space at the edges  */
