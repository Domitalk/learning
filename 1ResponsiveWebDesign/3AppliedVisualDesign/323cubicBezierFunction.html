    /* the cubic-bezier function is a way to manually control the the animation-timing-function instead of using one of the keywords 
    the inputs given to a cubic-bezier are (x1, y1, x2, y2)
    the grid that cubic-bezier operates on actually has 4 points of references on a graph 
    the first is (0, 0) and the last is (1, 1)
    (x1, y1) is p1/the SECOND point AND (x2, y2) the p2/the THIRD point on the graph 
    x is time and y is position so (0, 0) as p0 means that it starts off at 0% of transitional space at 0% of time 
    then (1, 1) means that at the end of the animation time the transition is at the 100% limit of the space position 
    AGAIN, x is TIME y is SPACE . each represent a percentage value of the limits of each timeframe and space-perscribed 

    p1 and p2 values will then create a curve based on the values given. or in the case of (0.25, 0.25, 0.75, 0.75) a straight line 
    as all the points of the graph are in a straight line it will be exactly the same */
