    /* ease-out slows down towards the end 
    with the cubic bezier values shown here, the graph looks flat at first and speeds up near the 0.58 time point to 1.0 space and turns flat.
    this would mean that there is a big jump around the early-middle but the end is super slow if it was visualized as movement 
    because the x1,y1 points are 0, 0 that means there is a straight line from 0,0 to 0.58, 1 so a fast movement at first 
    then the line peters out after 0.58, 1 because the y value can't increase.  */
