/* 
css is in most browsers Cascading Style Sheets, HOW TO DISPLAY CONTENT
it can handle colors, fonts, positions, spacing, sizing, decorations, transitions 
*/
/* 
You can either place CSS inside the JS HTML or make a seperate style ::-webkit-search-results-button
seperate style sheet is obviously preferred because of seperation of concerns
 */

 /* With css, it's important to get to know selectors that get HTML elements in the DOM  */
